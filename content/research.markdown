"Paying for Prestige: Compensating Differentials in Faculty Job Choice" (with [Alex Bell](https://alexbell.net/)). Draft available upon request.
* We investigate how faculty trade off salary and job amenities, particularly the prestige of their departments. To overcome the typical problems of the hedonic literature, we use the anti-instrumental variable approach popularized by Bell (2022). While compensating differential theory predicts such trade-offs, standard regression techniques fail to account for unobserved variation in faculty offer sets, leading to intuitively wrong-signed estimates. Our approach addresses this challenge by leveraging the relationship between a faculty member’s PhD-granting university quality, current institution salary, and current university prestige to better identify the salary-prestige tradeoff. Using de-identified data on over 180,000 faculty-field pairs in 325 U.S. universities across 107 fields, we find strong evidence that faculty are willing to forgo substantial earnings for positions at more prestigious institutions. While exact magnitudes vary with how one operationalizes "prestige," we consistently find the average faculty member must \emph{give up} on the order of \$1,000-\$2,000 in pay to move to the next-most-prestigious school. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of labor market dynamics in high-skilled professions, where non-monetary factors play a critical role in job selection. Our methodological approach offers new insights into the pricing of job amenities and how institutions compete for talent beyond academia.
